Welcome to my website!

Here I record the projects I developed in the data science/ data analysis field. 

I enjoy the process of making data easy-to-understand and accessible to people. It helps me gain deeper insights from real-world issues and thus come with a better solution. I also believe it's important to share findings and knowledge with other people because everyone has unique ideas to contribute.

Being at the end of my Social Sciences Bachelor at Humboldt University of Berlin, I've developed analysis skills in working with large and varied datasets with advanced statistical methods and acquired knowledge of data visualization with a variety of tools. 

In the coming weeks, I will be actively searching for **data science and data analyst internships**. Feel free to [contact me](https://www.chingchuhsu.com/contact/
