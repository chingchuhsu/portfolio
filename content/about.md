I began my Social Sciences Bachelor at Humboldt University of Berlin in 2016. During my studying,  I developed analysis skills in working with large and varied datasets with advanced statistical methods and acquired knowledge of data visualization with a variety of tools. 

In 2017, I joined a fintech startup in Berlin as an intern. With my data analysis and strategic thinking skills, I helped my team achieve high user engagement rate on social media channels.

Today, I am nearing the end of my study. In the coming weeks, I will be actively searching for data science and data analyst internships in Berlin, Germany.
